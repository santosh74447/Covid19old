# Covid19
A basic app to provide information on Cases of Coronavirus from worldometers.info and Novelcovid/api from github
# I have only uploaded the shared file and all the necesary code needed for the app.
#The file was big so I uploaded the file by archiving them.
# You can download the zip file, Unzip it and Use it in your shared section to run the code. 
# If you need help then please send me a message and I would be happy to help.
